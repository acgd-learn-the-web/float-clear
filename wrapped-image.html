	<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. The planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</p>
	<p>Venus is classified as a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth’s “sister planet” owing to their similar size, gravity, and bulk composition. However, it has been shown to be very different from Earth in other respects. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light.</p>
